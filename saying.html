	SAYS ".The edifice of the school and its moral fabric is guided by Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya i.e., ‘from darkness
	unto light’ and its motto ‘In Pursuit of Excellence’ constantly guides and motivates the staff and students 
	alike. Our goal is to achieve excellence in every field be it academics, sports, art or cultural activities.
	Every child is encouraged to achieve his / her optimum performance level. The school seeks to strike a dynamic
	balance between the need for education as understood in its simplest form i.e., the curricular and the 
	intellectual, physical, mental, aesthetic and moral development of its students. Special emphasis is also
	laid on value education, personality development and for social and environmental awareness as important 
	areas of education. In this regard the school encourages children of less fortunate and economically backward
	classes to join hands with the mainstream and interact with each other as one cohesive force."</P>
